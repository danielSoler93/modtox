DATE        WHO     CHANGE
20/08/2021  JN      --topological and --mordred arguments were passed as a string. 
                    Added eval() to transform to boolean.

                    Reshaped retrieve_molecules() into dictionary to avoid repeated
                    ligands by ChEMBL ID. 

                    Rewritten insert_zero_rows(). Using .append instead of concat. 

                    retrieve_molecules() returned glide instead of updated_glide, so 
                    model_input.csv was build using only docked molecules.

                    generate_features() presented problems at merging DataFrames due
                    to empty "_Name". Currently selecting by: "_Name" string contains ":". 
                    Better to use a property which is never null. Why not use "ChEMBL ID"? 
                    
                    generate_features() generates two DataFrames (mordred and fingerprints)
                    and inserts "Title" column in each of them.

                    New fun: merge_features() that merges mordred and fingerprints.

                    Set balancing before features calculation. Removes using a random index.
